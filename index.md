# Preface

You won't find benefits information in this book. You won't find out where to grab the source code for your apps. And you won't learn how to set up your computer. This book is about making the most of your time at your current (and possibly first) job, and the rest of your career. What can you do to make things easier on yourself? How do you work in a team, or on your own? How do you get a job in the first place?

This book is broken into chapters with tips and suggestions about starting a career in a technical field. You will, no doubt, find some of these tips to be obvious. Some of them you may not have thought about before. The ideas in this book are just a few of the stepping stones to the larger goal of a successful career, and hopefully an inner reflection on what drives you, and some ways for you to reach your goals easier.

Ready to dive in?

Let's get started.
